once upon a time  in a software company, there was a lonely programmer.
the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. He decided to go outside and buy a bucket of ice cream. He didn't want to share so he ate all of it. His officemates got mad at him and scolded him and then he cried so he is lonely again. He then went outside and bought lots of ice cream and treat everyone in the office so everybody's happily ever after. The END.
