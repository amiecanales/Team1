once upon a time  in a software company, there was a lonely programmer.
He decided to go outside and buy a bucket of ice cream. He didn't want to share so he ate all of it. His officemates got mad at him and scold him and then he cried so he is lonely again. He then went outside and bought lots of ice cream and treat everyone in the office so everybody's happily ever after.  
And he became health conscious he started to do some push ups, now he is tired and lonely. I therefore concluded that not all endings are happy.
